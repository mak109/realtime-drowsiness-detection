# Real-time Drowsiness Detection

This project was made as a part of **DA526(Image processing with Machine Learning)** course taken by **Prof. Debanga R. Neog Jan-May 2023**.
It aims to develop a real-time drowsiness detection system for individuals in a video feed. The system will first detect faces in the video and then classify them as drowsy,low vigilant or awake using a pretrained model trained on a dataset of alert,low vigilant and drowsy individuals. The model will output a probability score for each class, and the system will use a threshold to determine whether the individual is drowsy or awake along with localisation of the class(bounding box). This approach can have practical applications in driver safety and workplace safety, but the system's accuracy will depend on the quality of the face detection algorithm, the training data, and the threshold chosen.
